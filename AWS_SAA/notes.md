- AWS Fundamental Building blocks
    - Regions and AZs : AZs are like data centers in a region which is a general area e.g. us-east-1 ap-southeast-1. AZs doesn't necessarily mean just 1 data centre. There might be multiple in the same locality.
    - Each region has 2 or more AZs.
    - Edge locations are 'networking points of presence' make sure content is delivered to user from the nearest availaible source. Consists of cloudfront, CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    - Shared Responsibility Model :
        - You're likely responsible for things you can do yourself like choosing db instance etc. Things you can't do like wiring in data center, aws is responsible for those
        - encryption is a shared responsibility : i'm supposed to click encrypt, while AWS is supposed to follow through and actually encrypt the data
    - some key services :
        - Compute
            - EC2
            - Lambda
            - Elastic beanstalk : it is a provisioning service. it auto handles all the creation of load balancers etc.
        -  Storage
            - S3
            - EBS : Elastic block storage : a virtual hask disk we attach to our virtual machines
            - EFS : Elastic File storage
            - FSx
        - Databases
            - RDS
            - DynamoDB (non relational)
            - Redshift (data warehousing)
        - Networking
            - way of all these parts to comm.
            - VPC
            - direct connect : is a way to connect your on-premises data centers to aws
            - Route 53 : DNS services
            - API Gateway
            - AWS Global Accelarator
    - Well architected framework
        - go through the white paper on aws well architected. TBD : night-before-exam
        - Five pillars of well architected framework:
            - Reliability
            - Operational Excellence
            - Performance Efficiency
            - Security
            - Cost Optimization
    - Quiz
        - what are 5 pillars of well architected
            - reliability, operational excellence, performance efficiency, security, cost optimization
        - which is not a storage solution from aws
            - ec2
        - which statement describes edge location
            - A networking point of presence used for caching content
        - which statement best describes edge location
            - a physical location on globe with atleast 2 AZs in it.
- IAM :
    - Identity and Access Management is the way to granting access to AWS resources
    - Root account is the email ID with which we signed up for AWS. It has full admin access
    - how to secure root account :
        - go to security credentials from user dropdown on top right.
        - activate MFA (multi factor authentication)
            - it can be set up with google authenticator or another one i forgot
            - creating administrator groups and then assign it to the few people
    - how to control user actions with policy documents
