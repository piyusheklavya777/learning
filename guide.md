  - Quick Checks:
    - converting a -ve int to +ve for easier calc, beware of Integer.MIN_VALUE, absolute of which will overflow. use long.
    - accumulating a data type, use bigger data tyoe
    - changing / appending to strings often, use StringBuilder instead of just String
    - Integer overflow check in int total :
            if(Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 < total || Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 == total && Integer.MAX_VALUE % 10 < digit)
    - Splitting a string by "some string" : the some string is a regex so escape if needed, e.g. : "1.001.09".split("\\.",0) will work.
