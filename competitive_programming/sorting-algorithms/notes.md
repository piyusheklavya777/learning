# Sorting algorithms
- Selection Sort
    - ALGO :
        - Find the minimum element in 0 - n-1. Put it at position 0
        - Find the minimum element in 1 - n-1. Put it at position 1
        - Find the minimum element in 2 - n-1. Put it at position 2, and so on.
        - COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS :
            - TIME C: O(n^2)
            - SPACE C: No extra space is used. Also, no call stack is used.
